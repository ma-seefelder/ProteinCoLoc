## Description
ProteinCoLoc is a scientific software designed for Bayesian analysis of co-localization in microscopic images. Utilizing cutting-edge statistical methods, ProteinCoLoc provides accurate and detailed insights for molecular biology researchers. A graphical user interface is available that facilitates the use of the software. Additionally, a compiled version of ProteinCoLoc is available at Zenodo <a href = "https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10977960"> that does not require the installation of Julia. 


## Features
The key features of ProteinCoLoc are: 

- **Bayesian Modelling**: Robust statistical framework for co-localization analysis.
- **Automatic Background Detection**: Streamlines the analysis process with Otsu's thresholding.
- **Localization Analysis**: Detailed insights into specific cellular regions.
