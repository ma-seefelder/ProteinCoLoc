## Plotting functions

### Plot correlation of each image patch
The plotting method plots the merged `MultiChannelimage` an displays the computed correlation metric for each image patch. The correlation mechanism are chosen based on the `cor_method`argument: 
- `:pearson`: Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC)
- `:spearman`: Spearman's rank correlation coefficient
- `:kendall`: Kendall rank correlation coefficient

If `scale_channels` is set to true, the pixel intensities are scaled to a range between 0 and 1 using min-max scaling.

plot(
    img::MultiChannelImage,
    num_patches::T,
    cor_channel::Vector{T} = [2, 3];
    scale_channels::Bool = true,
    file::String = "test.png";
    channel_for_plot::Vector{T} = [1, 2, 3],
    save_to_file::Bool = true,
    cor_method::Symbol = :pearson
    ) where {T <: Int}
```

### Plot mask
As explained in our [paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-63884-1), we use Otsu thresholding to compute a mask. This mask can be visualised using the function `plot_mask(img::MultiChannelImage, file::String)`. In these images all masked pixels are depicted black and non-masked pixels that are included in the analysis are white.

### Plot local correlation plot

The local correlation plot allows for the visualisation of local colocalization patterns at a finer spatial scale and enables visualising variations in colocalization intensity within small image patches (ideally between 10 and 100 px). Robust estimates for individual patches are ensured by performing a correlation between intensities only if 15 or more pixels in a patch have intensities above Otsuâ€™s threshold for both channels. If the chosen number of patches is too high, the number of patches is dynamically adjusted until at least 15 pixels in a patch have non-masked intensities.
